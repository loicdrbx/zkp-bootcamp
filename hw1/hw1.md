<ol>
<li>
<p>Working with the following set of Integers S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6} , what is:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 + 4 = 8, 8 mod 6 = 2</li>
<li>3 x 5 = 15, 15 mod 6 = 3</li>
<li>3^-1 === 3^(6-2) (mod 6) ===  81 (mod 6)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>For S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6} Can we consider ‘S’ and the operation ‘+’ to be a group ?</p>
<ul>
<li>No, since for all a, b in S, the result of a + b is not also in S. For example, the result of  4 + 5 is not in S.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is -13 mod 5 ?</p>
<ul>
<li>-13 mod 5 = 2 since -13 = 5 (-3) + 2</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>x<sup>3</sup> − x<sup>2</sup>  + 4x − 12 is a polynomial of degree 2 and has positive root of x = 2</p>
